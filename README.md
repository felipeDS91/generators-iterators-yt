## 👨🏻‍💻 About this class
In this project we created an recursivity example that gets some data from an API.
We learn that Generator is used to not overwhelming the memory when is necessary process a large quantity of data.

### Tips
```npm ci --silent``` = Run Npm install using the exact libraries version especified on package.json

```console.table``` = Shows formatted table

```??``` (Node 14) = Tests if the condition is null or undefined

```for await``` = Used to deal with generators
